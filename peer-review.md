*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?

There's no error throughout the whole app.

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?

I know this is only for practice, But still, it would be nice to write a few words to enunciate it. Say, under "favorites" section, I was a little bit confusing to face a dropdown menu without context.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?

No.

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?

In componont "Bitcoin.vue", Atana use `async` before `mounted()` to not blocking the whole application. I have to read the manual to learn more about `async` and `await`. Thanks Atanas.


### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?

No.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?

No.
